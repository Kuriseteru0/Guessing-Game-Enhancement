Guessing Game using a Python Socket
The Guessing Game is a Python-based game using sockets, where players connect to a server to guess a randomly generated secret number between 1 and 100. The server provides feedback such as "Too low!" or "Too high!" until the correct number is guessed. After winning, players receive a performance rating based on their attempts. Additionally, a bot can play the game autonomously. The bot uses an optimal guessing strategy, binary search, to find the secret number and receives its score upon winning. Before playing this game, ensure you run the server with 'py server.py' before connecting the client with 'py client.py' and also ensure you input the correct password to play the game.
